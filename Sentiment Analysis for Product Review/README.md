# Sentiment Analysis for Product Review
# Overview
 This project involves the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** and **Machine Learning Algorithms** to analyze sentiments for product review.

# High-Level Steps
1. **Data Preparation**
       Loading the libraries and the dataset into Jupyter notebook.
       Data cleaning and data exploration is carried out
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
       The data is explored to understand the relationships that exists between them using charts and graphs.
   
3. **Data Preprocessing**
       The review text is cleaned using spacy to remove stopwords, spaces, brackets and hyperlinks, lemmatization and tokenization is carried out.
       The cleaned redview text is split into train and test data.
   
4. **Model Building**
       Using Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and K Nearest Neighbour Classifier, the model was built to analyze sentiments based on the reviews.
   
5. **Model Evaluation**
       Based on the performance of the models, Random forest Classifier worked best followed by Logistic Regression with K Nearest Neighbour with the least performance.  
  
6. **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard**
       The dataset was imported into tableau and analysis is performed and the dashboard published.
   

7. **Presentation**
       The presentation showing the steps taken, analysis done, visualizations used, insights and recommendations.
